I can make the changes for a smartphone or tablet by adjusting the sizes of the margins and padding to be percentages instead of values using pixels or em's. This allows for the screen/ciewport to change size depending on the device, allowing for one design to work for all devices. 

Design A:
This is a static design, but changing the margins to percentages and setting a max width of the viewport to change styles for different sizes would accomodate for different media types.

Design B:
In this design, I mad eit be useful for all types of devices by starting with smaller screens and once a larger viewport was available, changing into columns and adjusting the margins and size of the banner and footer.
